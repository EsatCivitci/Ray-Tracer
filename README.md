## Overview
This project implements a **basic ray tracing algorithm** to render 3D scenes with realistic lighting and reflections. The algorithm simulates the behavior of light rays interacting with objects, creating visually accurate images based on physical principles.

## Features
- **Ray Tracing Algorithm**:
  - Renders realistic 3D scenes by tracing the path of light rays.
- **Shading Models**:
  - **Diffuse Shading**: Simulates the scattering of light on rough surfaces.
  - **Ambient Shading**: Adds base-level illumination to the scene.
  - **Blinn-Phong Shading**: Simulates specular highlights for smooth, shiny surfaces.
- **Shadowing**:
  - Implements shadow calculations to determine areas blocked from light sources.
- **Reflection**:
  - Simulates the reflection of light on surfaces to create realistic mirror-like effects.
